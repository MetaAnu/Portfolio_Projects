# E-Commerce Sales Dashboard — Excel Portfolio Project

This project began with a simple question: *“What actually drives an online store’s performance?”*  
To answer it, I turned a raw spreadsheet of ecommerce transactions into a structured, insight-rich dashboard that reveals how customers behave, what they buy, and where the business gains or loses efficiency.

## 📖 Project Story

The dataset looked ordinary at first—orders, products, dates, prices.  
But beneath the surface were hidden patterns shaping the entire business:

- Why do some products consistently outperform others?  
- Which customers generate the most value?  
- Do delivery delays impact ratings?  
- How does geography influence demand?

By cleaning, modeling, and visualizing the data, the dashboard brings these answers into focus. Each chart works as a clue in understanding the system behind the sales.

## 🔍 What the Dashboard Reveals

- A small group of products—T-shirts, Jeans, Sneakers—drives most revenue.  
- The App channel dominates purchasing behavior, while others stagnate.  
- Most orders contain only 1–2 items, showing low basket expansion.  
- Female customers lead purchasing volume, but missing data weakens personalization accuracy.  
- Delivery is fast for most regions, yet a few slow deliveries directly reduce satisfaction.  
- Demand clusters heavily within a few California counties.

The dashboard turns these findings into a clear narrative of how the business operates day-to-day.

## 🛠 How It Was Built

- **Power Query** for cleaning and structuring the raw dataset  
- **Pivot Tables & Charts** for trends, segmentation, and product analysis  
- **Interactive Dashboard** with slicers for real-time filtering  
- **KPI Models** for Orders, Quantity, Revenue, Rating, and Delivery Days  
- **Geo-mapping** (county-level) to visualize regional demand  

Each component adds a piece to the full picture of ecommerce performance.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

The goal wasn’t just to visualize data—it was to understand behavior.  
This dashboard tells the story of:

- what customers prioritize,  
- how operations influence satisfaction,  
- and where the next growth opportunities are hidden.

It demonstrates how Excel, when used deeply, can turn raw data into business strategy.
