Atliq Hardware - Business Insights 360 Power BI Dashboards
Overview
This repository contains the Power BI dashboards developed for Atliq Hardware, providing a comprehensive 360-degree view of the company's performance across key business functions: Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain. The goal of this project was to transform raw business data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making, performance monitoring, and strategic planning.

Features
The Power BI solution is structured into several interconnected dashboards, each focusing on a specific business area:

Finance View:

Detailed Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement with Year-over-Year (YoY) change analysis.

Net Sales Performance over time, tracking trends and comparing against previous periods.

Breakdown of P&L values and YoY changes by region and product segment.

Key financial metrics including Gross Sales, Net Sales, Gross Margin, Net Profit, and associated percentages.

Sales View:

In-depth Customer Performance analysis, highlighting Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Gross Margin % for top customers (e.g., Amazon, Atliq Exclusive).

Product Performance breakdown by segment, showing Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Gross Margin %.

Performance Matrix visualizing Gross Margin ()vs.NetSales() across different regions.

Unit Economics insights, detailing the composition of Net Sales, various deductions, Total COGS, and Gross Margin.

Marketing View:

Comprehensive Product Performance analysis, including Net Sales, Gross Margin, Net Profit, and their respective percentages for each product segment (Accessories, Networking, Notebook, Peripherals, Storage).

Performance Matrix for products, showing GM% vs. NS$.

Region/Market/Customer performance analysis focusing on Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Net Profit, identifying high-performing and underperforming regions (e.g., negative Net Profit in NA).

Unit Economics visuals to understand the relationship between Gross Margin, Operational Expense, and Net Profit.

Supply Chain View:

Monitoring of Net Sales Performance over time, incorporating Forecast Accuracy and Net Error.

Key Metrics by Customer, including Forecast Accuracy, Net Error, and associated inventory risks (e.g., "Excess Inventory" or "Out of Stock").

Analysis of inventory risk by product segment, highlighting areas of concern (e.g., "Excess Inventory" for Networking and Storage, "Out of Stock" for Accessories, Peripherals, and Notebook).

Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop: For data modeling, transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation.

Data Sources (Assumed): Likely includes SQL databases, Excel files, and potentially other business systems for sales, finance, marketing, and inventory data.

Key Insights & Outcomes
Financial Growth: Identified significant year-over-year growth in Net Sales (282.57%) and Gross Margin (321.12%), indicating strong financial health.

Product Profitability: Pinpointed top-performing product segments (e.g., Notebooks leading in Net Sales and Gross Margin, Peripherals with highest Net Profit %).

Customer Segmentation: Enabled identification of high-value customers and regional performance disparities, such as strong performance in APAC and a negative Net Profit in North America.

Supply Chain Optimization: Highlighted critical inventory issues (excess inventory for some products/customers, out-of-stock for others) and provided metrics like Forecast Accuracy to improve supply chain efficiency.

Enhanced Decision-Making: Provided a centralized, interactive platform for stakeholders to monitor KPIs, identify trends, and make informed strategic and operational decisions.

How to Use (Conceptual)
To view and interact with these dashboards:

Power BI Desktop: If you have the .pbix file, open it directly with Power BI Desktop.

Power BI Service: If the dashboards are published to the Power BI Service, you can access them via your Power BI account through a web browser.

(Note: The actual Power BI file is not included in this repository. This README describes the dashboards based on provided screenshots.)
